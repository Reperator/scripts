# What's this?

This repository contains a few examples on working with the croit API from scripts:

## Backup/restore

`config.backup.sh` and `config.restore.sh` show how you can backup your croit configuration if you do not want to use our encrypted cloud backup service.

## Cluster installer

An example that shows how to work with the API, performs all steps that you'd manually click in the UI during setup.

## Nagios plugin

Make Ceph warnings available in Nagios, see [README.md](./nagios/README.md) in the nagios directory for details.
